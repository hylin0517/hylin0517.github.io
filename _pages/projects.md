## [Customer Churn Prediction](/projects/customer-churn-prediction/)
- **Goal:** Flag at-risk telecom customers before they churn.

- **Result:** ~87% accuracy with explainability via feature importance (contract type, tenure, monthly charges, support usage).
- **Stack:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib.
- **Links:** [Case study](/projects/customer-churn-prediction/) · [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hylin0517/AMS317-Group3)
