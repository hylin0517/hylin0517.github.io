<h1> About me </h1>
<p>
I'm currently a graduate student at Georgia Tech pursuing a M.S. in Analytics with a track focus in Computational Data Science & Machine Learning.
I attended Stony Brook University for my undergraduate studies, where I developed a strong foundation in Applied Mathematics & Statistics. 
</p>

<p>
Through personal projects and coursework, I have honed my skills in <strong>data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.</strong>
<i>Data</i> is an ambigious field nowadays, but to me, data is a tool that helps with storytelling and solve very big and complicated problems.
I mostly use <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong> for my data science projects, but love to create <strong>data visualizations</strong> to show how impactful data can be.
I am currently looking for internship and full-time opportunities in data science, analytics, and machine learning roles.
</p>

<p>
In my free time, I enjoy eating LOTS, discovering new places, learning new things [random and useless at times], and spending time with friends and family.
