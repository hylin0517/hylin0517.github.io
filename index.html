# Hi, I'm Hao 👋

Graduate analytics and data science student focused on turning messy data into clear decisions. I enjoy building end-to-end workflows — from cleaning and exploration through modeling, evaluation, and storytelling.

## What I work on
- Predictive modeling for churn, risk, and recommendation
- Exploratory analysis to surface actionable insights
- Visualization that makes results easy to act on
- Reproducible workflows in Python, SQL, and notebooks

## Recent highlight
- **Customer Churn Prediction** — XGBoost model with 87% accuracy to flag at-risk customers; feature importance for contract type, tenure, and pricing. [Read the short case study](/projects/customer-churn-prediction/).
